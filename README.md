# IMDb Movie Dataset Analysis & Visualization

## 📖 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the IMDb movie dataset. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights and trends from the movie industry through a multi-stage process: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R, data transformation in Power Query, and the creation of an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

The final dashboard offers a holistic view of the movie industry, covering financial performance, genre popularity, and geographical trends.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

The project was executed in three main phases, moving from raw data to a polished, interactive dashboard.

### Phase 1: [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R](https://github.com/Philopater-George/IMDb-Movie-Dataset-Analysis-Visualization/blob/main/01.EDA/IMDB%20EDA.pdf)
The initial analysis was performed in an R Notebook to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships.

  * **Libraries Used**: `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization.
  * **Key Activities**:
      * Inspected the data structure using `glimpse()` and `summary()`.
      * Visualized the distribution of movie **budgets** and **scores** using histograms.
      * Plotted the relationship between **budget** and **revenue**, revealing a positive correlation.
      * Identified the **top 10 movie-producing countries** and the **most popular genres** using bar charts.

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL) with Power Query

To prepare the data for visualization in Power BI, it was cleaned and modeled using Power Query. The main challenge was handling movies with multiple genres listed in a single cell. This was solved by creating a star schema with a fact table and a dimension table.

**1. Main Table (`IMDB`)**

This table contains the primary movie data.

  * **Data Cleaning Steps**:

    1.  Loaded the source CSV file.
    2.  Promoted the first row to headers.
    3.  Corrected data types for columns like `budget_x`, `date_x`, `revenue`, and `score`.
    4.  Removed empty rows and filtered out movies with a budget below $10,000 to ensure data quality.
    5.  Removed records with a blank `genre`.
    6.  Added a unique `Index` column to serve as a primary key.
    7.  The original `genre` column was removed, as it would be handled by the second table.

  * **M Code for Main Table**:

    ```m
    let
        Source = Csv.Document(File.Contents("D:\Documents\Data\IMDB\IMDB.csv"),[Delimiter=",", Columns=11, Encoding=65001, QuoteStyle=QuoteStyle.None]),
        #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
        #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Promoted Headers",{{"budget_x", Int64.Type}, {"country", type text}, {"date_x", type date}, {"genre", type text}, {"names", type text}, {"orig_lang", type text}, {"orig_title", type text}, {"Sum of Profit/Loss", type number}, {"revenue", type number}, {"score", Int64.Type}, {"status", type text}}),
        #"Removed Blank Rows" = Table.SelectRows(#"Changed Type", each not List.IsEmpty(List.RemoveMatchingItems(Record.FieldValues(_), {"", null}))),
        #"Filtered Budget" = Table.SelectRows(#"Removed Blank Rows", each [budget_x] >= 10000),
        #"Filtered genre" = Table.SelectRows(#"Filtered Budget", each ([genre] <> "")),
        #"Added Index" = Table.AddIndexColumn(#"Filtered genre", "Index", 1, 1, Int64.Type),
        #"Reordered Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(#"Added Index",{"Index", "budget_x", "country", "date_x", "genre", "names", "orig_lang", "orig_title", "Sum of Profit/Loss", "revenue", "score", "status"}),
        #"Removed Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Reordered Columns",{"genre"})
    in
        #"Removed Columns"
    ```

**2. Genre Table (`Genres`)**

This table was created to link genres to movies, establishing a one-to-many relationship.

  * **Data Cleaning Steps**:

    1.  The source data was loaded again.
    2.  An `Index` column was added, identical to the main table.
    3.  Only the `Index` and `genre` columns were kept.
    4.  The `genre` column was split by the comma delimiter, creating a new row for each genre associated with a movie.
    5.  Whitespace was trimmed from each genre name to ensure consistency.

  * **M Code for Genre Table**:

    ```m
    let
        Source = Csv.Document(File.Contents("D:\Documents\Data\IMDB\IMDB.csv"),[Delimiter=",", Columns=11, Encoding=65001, QuoteStyle=QuoteStyle.None]),
        #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
        #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Promoted Headers",{{"budget_x", Int64.Type}, {"country", type text}, {"date_x", type date}, {"genre", type text}, {"names", type text}, {"orig_lang", type text}, {"orig_title", type text}, {"Sum of Profit/Loss", type number}, {"revenue", type number}, {"score", Int64.Type}, {"status", type text}}),
        #"Removed Blank Rows" = Table.SelectRows(#"Changed Type", each not List.IsEmpty(List.RemoveMatchingItems(Record.FieldValues(_), {"", null}))),
        #"Filtered Budget" = Table.SelectRows(#"Removed Blank Rows", each [budget_x] >= 10000),
        #"Filtered genre" = Table.SelectRows(#"Filtered Budget", each ([genre] <> "")),
        #"Added Index" = Table.AddIndexColumn(#"Filtered genre", "Index", 1, 1, Int64.Type),
        #"Removed Other Columns" = Table.SelectColumns(#"Added Index",{"genre", "Index"}),
        #"Reordered Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(#"Removed Other Columns",{"Index", "genre"}),
        #"Split Column by Delimiter" = Table.ExpandListColumn(Table.TransformColumns(#"Reordered Columns", {{"genre", Splitter.SplitTextByDelimiter(",", QuoteStyle.Csv), let itemType = (type nullable text) meta [Serialized.Text = true] in type {itemType}}}), "genre"),
        #"Changed Type1" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Split Column by Delimiter",{{"genre", type text}}),
        #"Trimmed Text" = Table.TransformColumns(#"Changed Type1",{{"genre", Text.Trim, type text}})
    in
        #"Trimmed Text"
    ```

### Phase 3: [Dashboard Design & Visualization in Power BI](https://github.com/Philopater-George/IMDb-Movie-Dataset-Analysis-Visualization/blob/main/02.%20Dashboard/imdb%20Dashboard.pdf)

The cleaned data was used to build an interactive dashboard with two main pages: **Overview** and **Profitability**. The dashboard includes slicers for **Country** and **Status** that filter all visuals.

#### Overview Page

This page provides a high-level summary of the dataset.

  * **Key Metrics**:
      * **Total Movies**: 10K.
      * **Total Profit/Loss**: $1.89 Trillion.
      * **Total Genres**: 19 unique genres.
  * **Visualizations**:
      * **Total Movies by Country**: A bar chart shows the United States as the top producer with 4.9K movies, followed by Japan and France.
      * **Total Movies by Genre**: A bar chart highlights **Drama** (3.8K), **Comedy** (2.9K), and **Action** (2.7K) as the most produced genres.
      * **Total Movies by Language**: A pie chart reveals that **English** is the dominant language, used in 73.35% of the movies.

#### Profitability Page

This page focuses on the financial performance of movies.

  * **Key Metrics**:
      * **Profitable Movies**: 8,073 movies were profitable.
      * **Profitability Rate**: 80% of movies were profitable.
      * **Average ROI**: 2.92.
  * **Visualizations**:
      * **Profitability Rate by Country**: A bar chart shows that **Mexico (94%)** and **China (91%)** have the highest rate of producing profitable movies.
      * **Profitability Rate by Genre**: **TV Movie** and **Documentary** are the most consistently profitable genres, both with a 94% rate.
      * **Profit Margin by Genre**: **Documentary (82%)** and **TV Movie (78%)** also lead in terms of profit margin.

## 💡 Key Insights & Observations

  * **Geographic Dominance**: The **Australia** is the largest film producer by a significant margin in this dataset. **English** is overwhelmingly the primary language for films globally.
  * **Popular vs. Profitable Genres**: While **Drama** and **Comedy** are the most frequently produced genres, niche genres like **Documentary** and **TV Movie** have a higher profitability rate and profit margin.
  * **Global Profitability**: Although the US produces the most films, countries like **Mexico** and **China** demonstrate a higher efficiency in producing profitable movies. This suggests that massive production volume does not always equate to the highest rate of financial success.
